Gaming Tips
One of the most effective ways for dinosaurs to overcome challenges is by leaping in advance. This will make it possible for the dinosaur to jump over the cactus instead of waiting for it to run into it.
Although you can leap or jump over land animals, the dinosaur must crouch in order to avoid flying overhead. Crouching is a great way for the dinosaur to avoid flying reptiles.
Imagine that the dinosaur is still there, but the landscape and the obstacles are shifting around it. This grants you greater control over the game and paves the way for you to participate in it.
